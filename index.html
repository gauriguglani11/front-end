				In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student
				named Light Yagami finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black
				notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows both
				the target's name and face. After verifying that the notebook
				works and initially being terrified of its god-like abilities,
				Light begins to consider the possibilities of the Death Note's
				abilities and sets out to create a utopian world without crime,
				killing numerous high-profile Japanese criminals, before
				eventually targeting international criminals and felons around
				the world. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is
				visited by Ryuk, a "Shinigami", beings inspired by the Japanese
				god of death and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, who is
				invisible to anyone who has not touched the Death Note, reveals
				that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom
				and is amused by Light's actions.[5] As numerous criminals and
				convicts around the world begin to die of inexplicable freak
				accidents and heart attacks, the global media begin to believe
				that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious
				murders and name him "Kira" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration
				of the word: "killer"), who is both feared and beloved by the
				public and law enforcement agencies. Hoping to apprehend Kira,
				Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic and highly
				esteemed international consulting detective, known as L, who has
				cracked numerous crime cases around the world, to assist them in
				the investigation. After deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L
				stages a TV broadcast in which he tricks Light into revealing
				that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to
				kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as
				obstructing his plans. L quickly deduces that Kira has inside
				knowledge of the Japanese police's investigation, which is led
				by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that
				"Kira" could have familial connections with the members of the
				"Kira" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor
				the families of those connected with the investigation, but
				Light outmaneuvers and kills them all. Nonetheless, L picks up
				enough hints to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around
				this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L
				recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with both trying to get
				the other to reveal crucial information. At this point, a famous
				model/actress named Misa Amane gains a second Death Note from a
				Shinigami named Rem. Misa makes a deal with Rem for Shinigami
				eyes, which allows her to kill knowing only the face at the cost
				of half her lifespan. Misa commits numerous murders, sends taped
				recordings to the police, and eventually uncovers Light's
				identity as the original Kira. Infatuated with Light, she
				demands Light be her boyfriend. Although he does not love Misa,
				Light agrees, intending to use Misa's Shinigami eyes to discern
				L's true name. However, before she can do so, L deduces that
				Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem, who has
				feelings for Misa, threatens to kill Light if he does not find a
				way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa
				temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem
				pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke
				Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. Now with no knowledge of the Death
				Note, Light wholeheartedly joins the investigation. Together,
				Light and L deduce Higuchi's identity, arrest him, and discover
				the existence of the Death Notes and the Shinigami. When they
				touch the Death Note, Light and Misa regain their memories, and
				Light kills Higuchi with a piece of the Death Note, regaining
				possession of the book. However, L casts suspicion on Misa,
				forcing Rem to murder L to save her. Rem dies in the process, as
				it is forbidden for Shinigami to prevent humans from dying. The
				task force agrees to cover up L's death and appoint Light as the
				new L. The investigation stalls as a result. Four years later,
				crime rates worldwide have massively dropped, but cults have
				arisen which adore Kira. Two intelligent young men, who were
				raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and
				Mello. Both are aware that L is dead, and thus consider Light,
				the current L, a prime suspect. Mello, along with the Mafia's
				assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's
				death during the rescue mission. As suspicion starts to fall
				again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent
				supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints a well-known
				newscaster, Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson.
				Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her.
				Takada kills Mello with a hidden page of the Death Note but is
				killed by Light in order to dispel suspicions. Shortly after,
				Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting
				between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light
				seizes the chance to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the
				task force members. However, Mikami's Death Note fails to work.
				It is revealed that Near had replaced Mikami's Death Note with a
				decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's
				is missing, which proves Light is Kira. A scuffle breaks out
				during which Light is grievously wounded. Ryuk, realizing that
				Light will spend the rest of his life in prison, writes down
				Light's name in his Death Note—as he had promised to do at the
				beginning of the story. A year passes after Light's death, and
				while the world seems to have returned to normal, a large cult
				has secretly amassed, worshipping Kira as their god and saviour.
